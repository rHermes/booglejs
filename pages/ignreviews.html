<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>After finding <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sbkOF">this</a> data visualization, I was inspired to do the same thing,
but using D3.js and crossfilter instead. I extracted the data using python and scrapy. After having done that, I used
Google Refine to further clean up the dataset. After this I exported it as CVS and it is loaded by the site with D3.
Whay you are currently seeing is the results of the investigation.</p>

<h2>Score frequency comparison</h2>
<p>First up was comparing the frequency of scores given by the community versus IGN. It is worth noting that I've
excluded those entries which did not have a community rating. This leaves us with about 17120 reviews, so it is still a
good amount of reviews.</p>
